# Chat_on

Allow me to present you Chat_on, a group chatting application with a built in chat bot which
comes in both light and dark mode. Now, chatting with your closed ones is made easier with Chat_on.

Practically ask anything to the chat bot Mr. Chatty, thanks to Wolfram Alpha's awesome API.


## Installation

Install Chat_on

```bash
  Clone this repository.
```
    
```bash
  Keeping in mind you have flutter installed, now start the build process.
```

After the termination of build process, make the flutter app using the following code:

```bash
  flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

You will find the app being present in the output folder inside the android directory.

Install it in your device and enjoy!!!
